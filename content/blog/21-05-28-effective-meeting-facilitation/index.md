What can you do as a meeting facilitator to make a meeting fruitful, efficient
and satisfactory? There are many different types of meetings that you are
leading as a facilitator, e.g. meetings with students to discuss their
projects, research meetings, exercise classes, and more. This Un-workshop is a
platform for exchange and practice on the topic of meeting facilitation.  I am
organizing this Un-workshop because communication and facilitation is a big
interest of mine and I continuously want to improve on it. I collected some
experience on the topic while attending and facilitating many meetings during
my PhD at D-INFK and while organizing and facilitating workshops. I am
convinced that you also have lots of insights on the topic. In this un-workshop
you will have the opportunity to learn from your colleagues and share your
insights with your colleagues.  More concretely, we will practise facilitating
important parts of a meeting, e.g. the start and the end in small groups. Then,
we will discuss, reflect and come up with ideas and tools to make a meeting
more fruitful, efficient and satisfactory.  Please contact me (or reply in
thread) if you have inputs or questions regarding meeting facilitation that you
wish to have covered in this unworkshop. Also contact me if you want to
contribute an exercise to this unworkshop.
